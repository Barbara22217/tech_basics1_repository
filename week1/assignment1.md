## Assignment 1
**DUE 14 April Monday Noon**
- Create your first GitHub Repository with a `README.md` file, write some meaningful content in it and try to make it look nicer with some basic styling with `Mardown`. 
- Create a folder called `assignments` and another folder inside it called `week1`, put your first python printing exercise inside it. [See Exercise1.ipynb: make a little piece of ASCII art with print functions in python.]
- Put the link of your GitHub repository [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYFieCFpw-4lFO2S9FHEhjqngLjgRqUSfYNCtOjWvS0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Bonus
- Add an image into your `README.md`
- Familiarize yourself with the new tools we learnt today (Ex: figure out your favorite color scheme for the IDE)
